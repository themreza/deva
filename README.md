## Motivation

It takes significant effort to develop a trained eye that can spot design mistakes. 

The psychology of design is a profound science aimed at explaining how the human brain perceives design.

Over the years, various design principles and best practices have been established to serve as guidelines for 
creating effective designs.

This project is an attempt to create a visual design validation tool to detect design elements and assess 
conformity of the overall design to design principles and best practices.

"Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep." ~ Scott Adams

## Goals

- [ ] Create a database of design principles
- [ ] Create a visual element detection system
- [ ] Create an analysis engine to validate design elements against design principles

## FAQ

* How to find examples of design mistakes
  - Search Google for websites made using common website builders
    - `site:weebly.com`
    - `site:wix.com`
    - `site:squarespace.com`
    - `site:webnode.com`
    - `site:mozello.com`
* What is the advantage of using an input image instead of the HTML DOM?
  - Even though using an image as the design input makes it challenging to detect elements, it allows for 
  a platform-independent solution, regardless of the actual technical implementation of the design.
