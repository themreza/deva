## Motivation

It takes a significant effort to develop a trained eye that can spot design mistakes. 

The psychology of design is a profound science to explain how the human brain perceives design.

Over the years, a series of design principles have been established to serve as guidelines for creating 
effective designs.

This project is an attempt to create a visual design validation tool to detect design elements and assess 
conformity of the overall design to known design principles.

"Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep." ~ Scott Adams

## Goals

- [ ] Create a database of design principles
- [ ] Create a visual element detection system
- [ ] Create an analysis engine to validate design elements against design principles
